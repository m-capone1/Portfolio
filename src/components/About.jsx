                My journey into programming began during a mandatory introductory C++ course that was required for my Mechanical Engineering degree. I didn’t expect much from it, since coding wasn’t something I thought would become important in my life or my career.
                I vividly remember feeling really frustratred that I couldn't solve one of the weekly programming projects. No matter how much time I spent on it, I couldn’t figure it out. It was frustrating me so much so that I seriously considered giving up. I was convinced that maybe programming just wasn’t for me.
            
                When I finally cracked the probelm - something clicked for me. I think that first problem taught me a lot about perserverence, hard work, and the satisfaction that follows solving a complex problem. I then began to see programming differently. I found myself seeking out new challenges, excited by solving complex problems. 
                Programming quickly became more than just a requirement for my degree - it became a passion. I get a thrill from problem solving and I welcome new challenges. It motivates me to be a better engineer and to learn more each and every day.

                Although I have a background and expertise in Mechanical Engineering, I use programming as a tool to streamline processes and it is my long-term goal to fully transition into the software engineering indistry. The constant learning process and problem solving required in programming motivates me to push the 
                boundaries of what I can do. It’s no longer just about completing projects or fulfilling requirements; it’s about continuous improvement, both as an engineer and a learner. Embracing challenges, whether in tech or in life, has become part of who I am, and I can’t imagine a future without that thrill of discovery and growth.
