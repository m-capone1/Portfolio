Through extensive research, the team decided that building trust in AI can be achieved by presenting it in a way that is both educational and useful to Canadian users. The overall goal of OneHealth is to empower Canadians by providing them with easy access to their own medical records. When users view their records, the AI offers clear explanations of what they are seeing. This feature aims to enhance user understanding, reduce confusion around complex medical information, and gain Canadian trust in AIâ€™s role in healthcare."

The knee brace is equipped with strech resistance sensors capable of detecting the strain on the lateral and medial ligaments of the knee. I programmed the Arduino Nano using C++ to process real-time strain data from the sensors. The brace's structure was designed using SolidWorks and then 3D-printed. Testing was conducted with the device under different scenarios and data was collected to be analyzed. "
